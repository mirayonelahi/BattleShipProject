The main method (public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception), which appears in the Main.java file, runs the functions defined in the other packageâ€™s files (Battleship.java and BattleshiController.java).

BattleshiController.java 

This is the main controller for Battleship Game and all the data is accessed from the user or model and logics are generated here.

Here is the plan of the Battleship Game: -

Placing two ships (each ship takes up three cells on the board) on 10 by 11 grid.

After starting the game, user try to sink the ships by hitting the coordinates to "attack".

Each ship has three locations, so user need to store three hits for each ship and User will notify with a message up in the top when they have sunk battleships.
